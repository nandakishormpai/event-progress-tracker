# event-progress-tracker
A live leaderboard for an event which i am organizing in my college under Google Cloud. 
We used web scarping and thus avoided Database handling approaches as we have less than 100 participants to be tracked with lesser dimensions. 
Huge thanks to [Tanmay Ambadkar](https://github.com/TanmayAmbadkar) for helping me in updating the the scraping when there was a UI update in scraping source.
